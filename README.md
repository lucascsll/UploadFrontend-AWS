 ##### This project users can select or drag images to the upload zone.only and allow images 2 MB. If the image meets the requirements the field will turn green and change the text to "drop your image here".If the file is not an image, the upload will not be allowed, leaving red text and the upload zone.


#### This is a simple project for studying with MongoDB Databases.To backend I used the following libraries.
