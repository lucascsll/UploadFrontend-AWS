#### This project users can select or drag images to the upload zone.only and allow images 2 MB. If the image meets the requirements the field will turn green and change the text to "drop your image here".If the file is not an image, the upload will not be allowed, leaving red text and the upload zone.

#### When the upload is completed the user can open the link in s3 or delete the file.
